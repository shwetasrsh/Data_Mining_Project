INTRODUCTION

An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions - those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.
The objective is to predict whether a question asked on Quora is sincere or not.

An insincere question is defined as a question intended to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers. Some characteristics that can signify that a question is insincere:

- has a non-neutral tone
- is disparaging or inflammatory
- isn't grounded in reality
- uses sexual content
